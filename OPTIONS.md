## FAQ

**Q: Is there a setting or option in the addon to hide the ‘Not earned by: [character name]’ line in the achievement tooltip? Since the achievement is already completed by my warband, I’d prefer not to see which individual characters haven’t earned it.**

A: Yes! To hide the “Not earned by: [character name]” line in the tooltip and focus on warband progress:

1. Open the addon’s Options.
2. Go to **Layout → Achievements → Tooltip**.
3. Set the **Number of Not Earned By characters** option to **0**.

This will prevent the tooltip from listing any characters who haven’t earned the achievement, giving you a cleaner view focused on warband progress.
