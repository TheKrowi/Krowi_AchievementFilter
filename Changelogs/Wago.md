### Added
- Pandaria: Remix achievements (157)
- Achievements that require a calendar event to be active now show this in their tooltip
- Taintless library to hopefully eliminate some occurrences of "Interface action failed because of an AddOn" and "AddOn has been blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI" error messages
- Awakened Raids achievements to the corresponding raids so they show up in the current zone

### Changed
- Moved Many Boxes, Many Rockses from Dragonflight - Zones - Dragon Isles - Exploration to Dragonflight - Zones - The Waking Shores - Exploration

### Removed
- Ui Maps linked to Profession achievements for all expansions (dev note: it does not feel right to see profession achievements when you want to see which achievements you could do in the current zone you're in)
